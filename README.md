  osu!rmc is a project I started working on around mid-February 2025. It's very similar to Trackmania's RMC, but adapted to make it work well for osu!.

<p>If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to reach out to me on Discord or osu! DMs. You can also open an issue on this repository if you're familiar with GitHub.</p>
<p>I’m fully aware the code isn’t perfect—this project has been a huge learning experience, and I had to pick up a lot along the way. There are definitely many ways it can be improved.</p>
